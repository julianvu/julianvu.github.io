		<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
		
		<h2>Personal Bio</h2>
		
		<p>My name is Julian Vu and I am currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm also not originally from the Bay Area. I moved to San Jose from Orange County to go to school because I believe that getting an education surrounded by the companies for which I want to work would be advantageous to me.</p>
		
		<p>So far, living in the Bay Area has been amazing. I live very close to Apple's HQ. With a little drive I can get to Google's HQ, Microsoft, Nvidia, and other prominent tech companies that dot the Silicon Valley. San Francisco is also about an hour to two hours away, which makes for a great destination for a close-by getaway.</p>
		
		<p>When I'm not studying or doing homework, I'm learning new things on my own through many different online classes. I'm taking several programming classes on Udemy, a Git course on Udacity, and some other general skills courses on Lynda. I think it's amazing that people have access to these world-class courses on the Internet. There's no excuse not to learn how to do something you don't already know.</p>
		
		<p>For now, I'm delving into the realm of web development. Though I have had experience with front-end web development before, many years have gone by without practice. And I've never actually pushed a website to the Internet before. This will be my first! I'm excited to add more to my coding repertoire.</p>
